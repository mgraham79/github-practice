        <p>If you've ever owned a dog, you already know that they are the best animal companion. They provide us with a sense of emotional well-being thanks to the unconditional love they give, which is also why they're also great company and comfort for people who live alone. Owning a dog can help people to recover from personal trauma, such as bereavement or PSD.</p>
        <p>Studies have found that dog owners have lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol than non-dog owners and are less likely to have minor or serious health problems. Dog owners generally have a stronger immune system, helping them to stay well and spend less time getting over sickness and bugs. In fact, dog owners visit the doctor less often than non-dog owners, and are less likely to be on medication. People recover faster from illnesses and even have higher survival rates after a heart attack if they have a dog. Children who have a furry friend have fewer days off school due to sickness. Children with chronic illnesses often cope better with treatment when they have a canine companion. Dogs provide us with a sense of emotional wellbeing thanks to the unconditional love they give, which is why they’re also great company and comfort for people who live alone. Owning a dog can help people to recover from personal trauma, such as bereavement. Dog ownership can help those with mental health problems to recover and feel better. Taking your dog for regular walks really does help improve your fitness levels, and can help keep you healthy! Dog walking will often mean meeting other dog owners – meaning that you can make new friends at the same time as your dog! Walks can help give you valuable time to get away from it all and spend some time with your faithful friend.</p>
